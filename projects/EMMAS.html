            Overexertion is one of the biggest causes of injury in manual
            labour. It affects over 250,000 workers every year in the United
            States alone. However, using modern technology, we can aim to
            eliminate this issue. To solve the problem, we
            <span class="highlightedWords">(Jason Yin and I)</span>
            developed and created an active lower-body exoskeleton powered by
            pneumatic cylinders and controlled by a raspberry pi microcomputer
            with custom software. The goal of this device is to enhance mobility
            and provide mechanical assistance. The exoskeleton does so by
            manipulating the distance between the hip and the ankle which is
            electronically triggered from user inputs to our microcomputer,
            activating the pneumatic cylinders at specific timings through the
            exoskeleton's software. From testing, our mechanical assistance
            system provides <span class="highlightedWords">980N</span> of
            additional lifting capabilities, all while under a
            <span class="highlightedWords">0.54s</span> response time. Through
            the use of this tool, humans can reduce strain on their bodies,
            significantly reducing injury.

          <p>
            As civilization carries on growing to support its increasing
            population, the need for manual work only increases as there are
            more houses to build, packages to ship, and materials to move.
            Nevertheless, along with that work, comes the risk of strain and
            injuries on the human body: Every year in the United States, 255'000
            manual work labourers suffer from an injury resulting from
            overexertion.

            <br />
            <br />

            The concerning number of injuries generally stems from pushing,
            lifting, and carrying objects with improper technique. However, the
            reason for the improper technique often isn’t due to lack of proper
            training but rather due to the object being too heavy to use proper
            form on, forcing workers to place themselves in harm’s way. Using
            the incredible technological advancements humans have made, however,
            we have received the ability to eliminate this problem by enhancing
            the user's leg strength and mobility. Through the increase in
            strength, the user can once again return to focusing on their form
            knowing that they have the power to do so.

            <br />
            <br />

            To solve the problem affecting millions of people worldwide, we came
            up with an active lower-body exoskeleton that uses pneumatic power
            to extend and retract the leg with a superhuman amount of force.

          <h1 class="section-header">How</h1>
          <p>
            To supply additional power to the user to reduce overexertion
            injuries, we developed a rough idea for an exoskeleton that
            ultimately required four different systems: Frame, Air delivery,
            Battery, and Control.

            <br />
            <br />

            We would start by brainstorming the parameters required for each
            system. Then, we would research different ways to achieve these
            parameters through different methods. One reason why it was
            important to find different solutions was due to finding the optimal
            solution. For example, when designing, we had to decide on an
            actuator type to power the exoskeleton. We had three possible
            solutions (pneumatic, electric motor, and hydraulic) and with them,
            we determined the best powertrain through calculations. In that
            specific case, our calculations were to find the actuator with the
            maximum power output, lowest electricity consumption, and minimal
            weight.

            <br />
            <br />

            Once we had ample research, we moved on to design. When possible, we
            would model in a 3d virtual environment to best understand the
            interactions of our design with other systems. Another benefit of
            modelling was the available stress and displacement tests that would
            inform us of any inadequacies.

            <br />
            <br />

            Next, we consulted professors. Through this method, we would be
            aware of any oversights we may have made and would be notified of
            any better solutions.

            <br />
            <br />

            Finally, we would choose the material to prepare for manufacturing.
            Strength to weight ratio was always the focus. For example, we chose
            Aluminum 6061-T6 for the material.

            <br />
            <br />

            After all systems were completed and attached, we tested the
            performance of the exoskeleton through different experiments to
            optimize performance.

            <br />
            <br />

            To find the most accurate sources of information, we focused on
            receiving our knowledge from university research papers,
            manufacturer datasheets, and when possible, patents. Through this
            methodology, we were able to be confident that our solutions and
            calculations would yield the best results.

            <br />

            BATTERY/POWER:

            <br />
            <br />

            The main design criteria was high energy density to minimize weight.
            To achieve that, we leveraged the latest lithium-ion technology. By
            placing the batteries (18650 cells) in a 7 series 3 parallel design,
            we achieved a 250 Wh battery weighing 1kg. We then used a 24V
            stepdown converter for the air compressor and microcomputer.

            <br />
            <br />
          </p>

          <div class="text-about-image-capsul">

              src="../pictures/EMMAS/Board.jpg"

          </div>

          <p>
            <br />
            <br />

            AIR DELIVERY SYSTEM:

            <br />
            <br />

            The air delivery system actively pumps air into the pneumatic
            cylinders. To control the flow of air, we developed a design that
            had an air compressor pump air into an air tank that would branch
            off into the two legs. On the legs, there would be two types of
            solenoid valves that control the flow using signals they receive
            from the computer to either let the air go through or not. The first
            layer of solenoid valves works off Pulse Width Modulation to control
            airflow through the tank (More details on P.W.M in the controls
            section) while the second layer uses P.W.M. to exhaust air when
            necessary.

            <br />
            <br />
            Control: (Software:
            <a href="https://github.com/HOPE028/EMMAS" target="_blank"
              >https://github.com/HOPE028/EMMAS</a
            >)

            <br />
            <br />

            The microcomputer's role is to analyze the user’s input and send
            signals to the solenoid valves. To do so, the microcomputer sends 0
            and 1 bits in the form of voltage to control the valve’s state. The
            valve’s state is what decides if air goes through or not. Building
            on top of that, we used the P.W.M framework for precise power
            control. To utilize it, we send signal changes at a high frequency
            to regulate the flow rate. All inputs are received from buttons and
            switches. Through the inputs, the user can change what mode the
            exoskeleton is in which affects how the exoskeleton behaves.

            FRAME:

            <br />
            <br />

            During the motion of squatting, the distance between the hip and
            ankle reduces. By being able to manipulate the distance between
            these two leg parts, we can mimic the leg’s movement. The pneumatic
            cylinder allows us to do exactly that through the manipulation of
            its own length by pumping air into its chambers when the ends are
            attached to the ankle and hip.

            <br />
            <br />

            When the pneumatic cylinder is compressing, however, it has the
            ability to buckle the knee. In response, we created a frame for the
            pneumatic cylinder to be attached to. The frame ensures that the
            force from the pneumatic cylinder is limited to one degree of
            freedom and that frame and pneumatic cylinder do not slide relative
            to the body.

            Power output under constant load:

            <br />

            We tested constant load performance by attaching one end of the
            pneumatic cylinder to a scale and the other end to a solid base.
            Through 40 different trials at 5 different pressures inside the
            air-delivery system, we received performance data.

            Actuation time:

            <br />

            We tested actuation time by setting the system at 60psi and
            measuring the time between the user turning on the power and the
            time it took for the system to start providing power.

          <p>
            The exoskeleton enhances the user's ability in ways we could not
            have dreamed of. It provides incredible power at an explosive pace.
            Providing up to 2940 newtons of force (at 150 psi theoretically) in
            less than 0.54 seconds, the user can achieve tasks never thought to
            be possible by humans. For testing equipment purposes, however, we
            were never able to reach that pressure inside the chambers due to
            safety concerns and air leakages stemming from prototyping. Instead,
            we tested with lower pressure that a user would more realistically
            use in real-life environments. The results were still very
            impressive.

            <br />
            <br />

            The first set of tests we did was reserved for seeing the power
            output from the pneumatic cylinders when attached to the rest of the
            system. The tests showed that when the system was running at 60 psi
            (pressure inside the air delivery system), the pneumatic cylinders
            could provide over 980N of force, more than enough force to lift
            most users without the user's leg needing to do any work at all.
            This would result in a substantial reduction of strain on the user's
            body and give the user increased lifting capabilities.

            <br />
            <br />

          <div class="text-about-image-capsul">

          </div>

          <p>
            <br />
            <br />

            Next, we tested the actuation time to test how fast a user could
            receive the power of the exoskeleton. At 60 psi, the system would
            take on average 0.54 seconds. That is fast enough so that the user
            could carry on with their regular work pace while being aided by the
            power of the exoskeleton.

          <p>
            The possibilities for improving the exoskeleton are endless. Some
            notable optimizations would be a slightly modified frame with a more
            ergonomic design, a more simple user interface that uses artificial
            intelligence to predict the user's needs, and custom air compressors
            and pneumatic cylinders to reduce weight and size.

            <br />
            <br />

            We will work on these future improvements by using what we have
            learnt over the span of this project such as consulting experts when
            necessary, modelling more precise and thought out designs, and
            having backup plans if ever something does not work out.
