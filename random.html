      <p>
        As civilization carries on growing to support its increasing population,
        the need for manual work only increases as there are more houses to
        build, packages to ship, and materials to move. Nevertheless, along with
        that work, comes the risk of strain and injuries on the human body:
        Every year in the United States, 255'000 manual work labourers suffer
        from an injury resulting from overexertion.

        <br />
        <br />

        The concerning number of injuries generally stems from pushing, lifting,
        and carrying objects with improper technique. However, the reason for
        the improper technique often isn’t due to lack of proper training but
        rather due to the object being too heavy to use proper form on, forcing
        workers to place themselves in harm’s way. Using the incredible
        technological advancements humans have made, however, we have received
        the ability to eliminate this problem by enhancing the user's leg
        strength and mobility. Through the increase in strength, the user can
        once again return to focusing on their form knowing that they have the
        power to do so.

        <br />
        <br />

        To solve the problem affecting millions of people worldwide, we came up
        with an active lower-body exoskeleton that uses pneumatic power to
        extend and retract the leg with a superhuman amount of force.
